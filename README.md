### CURRENTLY OPEN TO WORK
Currently looking for my next opportunity

### Who I am
I am a husband, father, and avid developer. I love engineering in Ruby and have been using it for over 10 years. I also am eager to learn new technologies and languages and even named my first company as a contractor, iCodeThat, to express my desire to learn as much as I could. As a result I've professionally worked with C#, .NET, Coldfusion, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS. I've also had some exposure to Python, PHP, and Java in my professional experiences as part of related projects that I was a part of. 

### What I've Done
Check out my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-buttig/) to see contributions to products I've made in the past. Unfortunately, most of that work has been to private repos.

Since 2013, I've primarily been a Ruby on Rails Developer engineering large-scale SaaS web applications. These contributions have been heavily focused on architecting APIs as part of a micro service architecture and engineering fullstack solutions to a large admissions management platform using Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### What I'm Working On
Here in my GitHub, you can find tutorials I run through to refresh and expand my knowledge. As part of this you'll see several projects here that I'll be working on especially in JS and React. I also plan to put up my pet project, a Ruby/React web application to help homeschool families manage their students' education more efficiently.

### What I'm Learning
My current goals are to solidify my front-end knowledge and keep up to date on modern JS frameworks to complement my backend expertise.
